## Methods

We employed the latest deep learning architectures and algorithms in this project. The specific methods include:

1. **Feature Extraction** - Using convolutional neural networks to extract image features
2. **Attention Mechanism** - Implementing self-attention layers to capture long-range dependencies
3. **Contrastive Learning** - Applying contrastive loss functions to learn more discriminative representations

The architecture of our method is shown below:

```
Input -> Feature Extraction -> Attention Layer -> Contrastive Learning -> Output
```

## Mathematical Formula Support

Our model can be represented by the following equation:

$$
L(x, y) = -\log\frac{\exp(sim(h_i, h_j)/\tau)}{\sum_{k=1}^{2N} \mathbf{1}_{[k \neq i]} \exp(sim(h_i, h_k)/\tau)}
$$

Where:
- $h_i$ and $h_j$ are representations of positive sample pairs
- $\tau$ is a temperature parameter
- $sim(u, v)$ is the cosine similarity function

## Results

Our experimental results show that this method achieved good performance across multiple benchmark tests:

| Dataset | Accuracy | Recall | F1 Score |
|-------|-------|-------|--------|
| CIFAR-10 | 95.2% | 94.8% | 95.0% |
| ImageNet | 92.1% | 91.5% | 91.8% |
| COCO | 88.7% | 87.9% | 88.3% |

As shown in the figure below, our method (red line) has a significant advantage compared to other methods (blue and green lines):

## Conclusion

This study demonstrates that combining feature extraction, attention mechanisms, and contrastive learning can significantly improve model performance. Our method achieved good results across multiple datasets.

Future work includes:
- Expanding to more domains and application scenarios
- Improving the computational efficiency of the model
- Exploring variants more suitable for few-shot learning
