## Context & Scope

Crude oil is a complex mix of hydrocarbons, with its exact composition varying based on where it comes from. Different crude oils are often blended throughout the supply chain—from production to refining—primarily to meet specific refinery requirements and optimize profit margin. This blending process is crucial because the resulting distillation profile, which indicates how the blend evaporates at different temperatures, directly determines the types and quantities of refined products like gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel that can be extracted.

This work compares a data-driven machine learning approach with a rule-based approach derived from physical laws. Both models predict the mass-fraction distillation profile of oil blends, using the blend ratio and the individual crude distillation profiles as inputs.
