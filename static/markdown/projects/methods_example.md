# Methods Section

This project employs various state-of-the-art techniques to solve complex image classification problems.

## Model Architecture

We designed a Transformer-based architecture that combines the advantages of vision and language models:

```
Vision Transformer -> Cross-Modal Fusion -> Language Model
```

## Training Strategy

We adopted a two-stage training strategy:
1. **Pre-training Stage**: Self-supervised learning on large-scale unlabeled data
2. **Fine-tuning Stage**: Supervised fine-tuning on task-specific data

## Loss Functions

The model uses a combination of multiple loss functions:
- Cross-entropy loss for classification tasks
- KL divergence for knowledge distillation
- Reconstruction loss for the autoencoder component

$$L_{total} = \alpha L_{CE} + \beta L_{KL} + \gamma L_{recon}$$

where $\alpha$, $\beta$, and $\gamma$ are weight hyperparameters.
